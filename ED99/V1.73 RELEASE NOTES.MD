### ED99 v1.73 Release Notes

After finding some bugs in the Camel99 Forth kernel and improving some
underlying library code here is what I believe is workable version of ED99
in both 40 column mode for stock systems and 80 column mode for the F18A card.

## Changes
built on the latest Camel99 V2.69 kernel
Re-write of the repeating key code specific for ED99  
Fixed SAMS initialization code so that it works correctly on real iron and TI-99
embedded Font loader into the program
Simplified config file
faster cursor movement
faster startup.  
Handles 5 sessions of 800 lines with an 800 line clipboard
COLD command does a COLD boot of the editor re-loading the config file

## Bugs Killed
Earlier versions had a random chance of dropping a random character in your text
when using the cursor keys. Not very pleasant.

Built in DIR and CAT commands

Text search using the LOC <text string>  command.


### Un-published feature
Since Forth is still resident you can customize  commands to suite your tastes
as Forth definitions.  New commands can be added to ED99CONFIG so they load on
startup
