Version 2.0.8

For this update we have changed some key low level words to CODE words. (HERE ALLOT)
This has improved compilation speed. 

We changed >DIGIT and HOLD to CODE words and number output to the screen is over 50% faster.

For better consistency with the Original CAMEL Forth code we put /STRING back into the HI level source file CAMEL2.HSF.
It is still a CODE word as it was in V1.9 but it is no longer in 9900FAST.HSF.
