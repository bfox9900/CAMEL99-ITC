Version 2.0.8

For this update we have changed some key low level words to CODE words.
(HERE ALLOT) This has improved compilation speed.

We changed >DIGIT and HOLD to CODE words and number output to the screen is
over 50% faster.

For better consistency with the Original CAMEL Forth code we put /STRING back
into the HI level source file CAMEL2.HSF.
It is still a CODE word as it was in V1.9 but it is no longer in 9900FAST.HSF.


Nov 2 2019  Version 2.5
Made final decisions on balance of CODE words and High Level Forth for the
Kernel trading off size and speed. There is now only 1 version of CAMEL99 Forth.
(Indirect threaded)

- General cleanup of the library
- Improved CREATE/DOES> uses branch and link instruction
- Addition of CODEMACROS file to demonstrate how to add machine Forth words
- Implemented CREATE/DOES> in Direct Threaded version.
- Added Automotion for Sprites that uses the same motion system used by
  TI Extended BASIC. (SEE: Demo folder for usage examples)
- Speed improvements to DIRECT sprite control library.

Bugs:
- You cannot clear the screen while automotion is running. Re-define the word
CLEAR to STOPMOTION CLEAR AUTOMOTION if you need to erase the screen with
automotion running.

Note on DTC Version:
DTC CAMEL99 was created for analysis. This has shown that although there is
14% average speed increase in general over the ITC version the extra code size
is not advantageous for the memory constrained TI-99.

### Nov 28, 2019  V2.5
Indirect Threaded Version
- Settled on one build of CAMEL99 Forth. All variations are removed.
- 25% speed up of CREATE DOES> structures by using BRANCH & LINK instruction
- Fixed DSK1.ANSFILES file handle bug. Errors did not release current file handle.
- Improved VDP screen driver using 1+@ code word
- Improved DSK1.VALUES. Faster TO and +TO
- Cleaned up LIB.ITC. TI99 versions are in DSK1.
- Added DSK1.TRAILING. (-TRAILING -LEADING TRIM)
- Added DSK1.HEXNUMBER. H# is a prefix word to interpret numbers as radix 16.
- DSK1.TOOLS now includes VDUMP for VDP ram and SDUMP code for SAMS card.
  (HEX and BINARY numbers alway print unsigned after tools are loaded.)
- DSK1.CODEMACROS provides native 9900 indexed addressing arrays.
- DSK1.VTYPE improved VTYPE updates VCOL. AT" ( x,y) placing text.
- DSK1.AUTOMOTION provides Automatic sprite motion like Extended BASIC


### Known BUG (Not a bug)
- When INCLUDE is used for a file on a disk other than DSK1, the library files will try to load from that same disk.  Investigating our FILESYSX for the problem.
- Resolved. It was a configuration error in the Classic99 Emulator.

Update: 2.67D

Completely knew VDP driver. Up to 20% faster on some things

S"
Action is ANS standard for compiling strings into definitions
BUT it is non-standard because it is an state smart word. Does different things for compiling and interpreting
It now accepts multiple strings in interpreting mode as long they are input on the same line.
Example:   S"  String #1"  S" String#2 "  S" String #3"  <ENTER>
                returns three separate stack strings to the data stack.

Some library files have been made smaller
ANSFILES, GRAFIX

Slightly faster number printing.
