Version 2.0.8

For this update we have changed some key low level words to CODE words.
(HERE ALLOT) This has improved compilation speed.

We changed >DIGIT and HOLD to CODE words and number output to the screen is
over 50% faster.

For better consistency with the Original CAMEL Forth code we put /STRING back 
into the HI level source file CAMEL2.HSF.
It is still a CODE word as it was in V1.9 but it is no longer in 9900FAST.HSF.


Nov 2 2019  Version 2.5
Made final decisions on balance of CODE words and High Level Forth for the
Kernel trading off size and speed. There is now only 1 version of CAMEL99 Forth.
(Indirect threaded)

- General cleanup of the library
- Improved CREATE/DOES> uses branch and link instruction
- Addition of CODEMACROS file to demonstrate how to add machine Forth words
- Implemented CREATE/DOES> in Direct Threaded version.
- Added Automotion for Sprites that uses the same motion system used by
  TI Extended BASIC. (SEE: Demo folder for usage examples)
- Speed improvements to DIRECT sprite control library.

Bugs:
- You cannot clear the screen while automotion is running. Re-define the word
CLEAR to STOPMOTION CLEAR AUTOMOTION if you need to erase the screen with
automotion running.

Note on DTC Version:
DTC CAMEL99 was created for analysis. This has shown that although there is
14% average speed increase in general over the ITC version the extra code size
is not advantageous for the memory constrained TI-99.
