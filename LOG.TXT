### Version 2.0.8
For this update we have changed some key low level words to CODE words.
(HERE ALLOT) This has improved compilation speed.

We changed >DIGIT and HOLD to CODE words and number output to the screen is
over 50% faster.

For better consistency with the Original CAMEL Forth code we put /STRING back
into the HI level source file CAMEL2.HSF.
It is still a CODE word as it was in V1.9 but it is no longer in 9900FAST.HSF.


### Nov 2 2019  Version 2.5
Made final decisions on balance of CODE words and High Level Forth for the
Kernel trading off size and speed. There is now only 1 version of CAMEL99 Forth.
(Indirect threaded)

- General cleanup of the library
- Improved CREATE/DOES> uses branch and link instruction
- Addition of CODEMACROS file to demonstrate how to add machine Forth words
- Implemented CREATE/DOES> in Direct Threaded version.
- Added Automotion for Sprites that uses the same motion system used by
  TI Extended BASIC. (SEE: Demo folder for usage examples)
- Speed improvements to DIRECT sprite control library.

Bugs:
- You cannot clear the screen while automotion is running. Re-define the word
CLEAR to STOPMOTION CLEAR AUTOMOTION if you need to erase the screen with
automotion running.
Fixed: This was due to interrupts being enabled sometimes during VDP I/O.

### Note on DTC Version:
DTC CAMEL99 was created for analysis. This has shown that although there is
14% average speed increase in general over the ITC version the extra code size
is not advantageous for the memory constrained TI-99.

### June 26, 2021
Version 2.67D  fixes a lot of previous issues with the VDP chip driver.
There were many things I did not understand in the past.


### Camel V2.68 Notes
July 20, 2021
Found a bug in M+ after working on porting a PI digit calculator.
M+ is also used in >NUMBER and so was a ticking bomb all this time.

### Camel 2.68G
Jan 2022
Changed build method to use a building file FORTHITC.MAK
Changed TI99IO file to use sub-routines for some operations.
This is to allow future linking to Assembler if needed.
Found bug in how to build SuperCart version so CAML99SC running out of memory
at HEX 6000 if the E/A SuperCart is installed. Works in Classic99 Emulator as
well.


June 3 2025

V 2.8 Kernel for expansion RAM and Super Cart version.
Changed back to using CMOVE CMOVE> per Forth 2012 spec.
Added MOVE to kernel which moves CELLS.  It is 2X faster when you need that.
