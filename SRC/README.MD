#SOURCE CODE NOTES
As of Nov 30, 2018 there are two versions of the system.
An indirect threaded system and a direct threaded system for demonstration.
In performance tests the direct threaded system is about 10..15% faster but
consumers more space for every Forth word defined.  
On the TI-99 it is probably not worth the extra complexity because memory is at
at premium
