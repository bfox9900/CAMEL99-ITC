#SOURCE CODE NOTES
As of Nov 30, 2018 there are two versions of the system.
An indirect threaded system and a direct threaded system for demonstration.
In performance tests the direct threaded system is about 10..15% faster but consumers more space for every Forth word defined.  On the TI-99 it is probably worth the extra complexity.
