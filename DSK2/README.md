# Demo programs
This folder contains some DEMO programs in Forth and BASIC.

Files with no extension are BASIC.  

'.F' files are DV80 Text files of source code for CAMEL99

There is also a Font file that takes time to compile but it changes the lower case font to something better than stock.
You must INCLUDE MARKER.F  and GRAFIX.F  to load SANSERIF.F
