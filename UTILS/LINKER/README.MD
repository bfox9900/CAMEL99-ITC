# Object Code Linker for TI-99

This program allows the user to interpret TI-99 object files generated by the
assembler and other compilers. The LINKER program converts the object file into
machine code to create an executable binary program.

The user can inspect the machine code and run it from the Forth command line.
If the code is properly written with DEF statements as sub-routines or
sub-programs the programs will return to Forth.

The finished code can be saved out to disk as an executable program that
can be loaded by the TI-99 Editor/Assembler cartridge.

The Zip file contains the example programs written up in the PDF manual
