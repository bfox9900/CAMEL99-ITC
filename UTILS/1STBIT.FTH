\ explanation: 
\ Let us consider the 1st set bit. On the first step, DUP 1 RSHIFT OR,
\ it gets copied to the bit that follows it. On the 2nd step, it gets
\ copies to the two bits that follow the two bits mentioned on the 
\ previous step. And so on. Finally, all bits below the first set bit
\ become set. 
\ Then, 1 RSHIFT XOR clears all set bits except the very 1st one.
