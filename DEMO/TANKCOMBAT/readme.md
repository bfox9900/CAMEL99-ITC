# Tank Combat Exploration  

This demo comes from the mind of @vorticon on artiage.com.
He wrote this up in BASIC and allowed programmers to write their own
strategic code to try and destroy their enemies.

It liked something that would benefit from the Camel99 Forth Multi-tasking system so I played with it.

It needs more work.
