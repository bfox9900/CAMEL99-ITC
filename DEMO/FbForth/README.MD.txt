# Files for FbForth

Files in this folder are things that I ported over to run under FbForth.

FbForth is a complete re-write of the original TI-Forth for the TI-994A.
It is the work of Lee Stewart who can be found on Atariage.com.

FbForth fixes a great many of the weaknesses in the original TI-Forth system
and also moves the entire kernel into a cartridge, the native distribution
format for TI-99 software.
