# Bit Map Mode on TI-99

This folder contains GRAPHICS2.0.FTH that switches the TI-99 into bitmap mode
written in Forth and then a set of files that slowly improved the performance 
of the PLOT routine by using the Forth Assembler. 

For the Forth student this can give you some ideas of how to incrmentally
add Assembler to your programs to improve speed. 

The demo program FLOGO2 creates a simple "Turtle graphic" system that
draws a number of shapes that you can use to see the speed changes.
