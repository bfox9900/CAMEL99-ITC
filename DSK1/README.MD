# TI-99 Library Files

These files have no extension because the TI-99 file system uses the '.' character to delimit device names and parameters. These files are all in the default format for assembler source code on the TI-99. This format is described as DISPLAY, VARIABLE 80, SEQUENTIAL or DV80 for short.

DV80 means ASCII text characters are the only characters in the file and the records are 80 bytes long. The files records must be accessed sequentially.

They are edited with the Editor assembler Editor program (EDIT1) or the third party 80 column editor called EDIT80.
