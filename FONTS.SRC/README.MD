# FONTS in CAMEL99 Source Code Format

These files demonstrate how to create a font in source code and save it as a binary file.
For a way to design fonts or graphic shapes the Magellan program is excellent.

Magellan does not export data in an exact format for Forth.
I typically export Assembler DATA and use the DSK1.DATABYTE libary to provide the easiest way to get the data into Forth.
Some text editing is still required.
