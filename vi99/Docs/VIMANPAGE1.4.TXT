VI99 is a small editor that acts like vi but is NOT 100% vi.                    
VI99 starts up in the VI99 shell. VI99 shell is like the a rudimentary          
UNIX shell program. It gives you the ability to run some other programs.

The colon (:) command moves to bottom of screen and waits for another command.  
The commands below are completed by hitting the <Enter> key.

:x  <Enter>  quit vi, write modified file to file named in original invocation   
:wq <Enter>  quit vi to the command shell.  Changes are saved                    
:q  <Enter>  quit vi to the command shell.  Changes are saved

  >>> The colon command feeds text to the Forth interpreter     <<<
  >>> so any unknown "colon" command bounces you into the shell <<<
