## vi99 Editor for TI-99

This is an attempt to make a vi work-alike editor for TI-99.
The Forth interpreter replaces the O/S shell providing ls and ls-l commands. 'vi' starts the editor. 

The editor is not a complete version of vi but provides some basic
functionality. 

### Hardward Requirements
vi99 is an 80 column editor and therefore requires the F18 video card or equivalent functionality on an emulator like Classic99.
